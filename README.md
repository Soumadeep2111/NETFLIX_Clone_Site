# NETFLIX_Clone_Site

This ia a web development project of a clone web site of netflix.com. 

Netflix is a very popular website in the field of entertainment of people. It hosts many movies, web-series, documentaries which are released throughout the internet for the entertainment of peole at a certain charge.

I have tried to depict a similar home page of netflix.com using :
1) HTML
2) CSS
3) Javascript
4) Reactjs
5) API from api.themoviedb.org

To start the app :
1) open a new terminal (i.e in VS Code)
2) type " npm i "
3) then, type " npm start"

And, it should be redirection you to your browser.
